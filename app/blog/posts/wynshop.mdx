# Wynshop Contributions

At Wynshop, I am part of the **core team**, specifically on the Golden Goose (GG) mobile team. Our team works globally with 20+ organizations and manages configurations for over 40 banners. _(Banners represent different brands under the main retailer organization.)_

When I joined, the GG mobile team consisted of 4 developers and faced significant pressure to re-establish the mobile application. During review sessions, we identified major UI/UX discrepancies and severe performance issues.

## Key Achievements

### Performance Improvements

We implemented several solutions to address performance bottlenecks:

- **Optimized API Response Handling**:
  - Proper cache utilization for faster data retrieval.
- **Faster Local Storage**:
  - Integrated **MMKV** for significantly improved storage speeds.
- **List Rendering Optimization**:
  - Replaced `FlatList` with **FlashList** for enhanced rendering performance.
- **Streamlined Dependencies**:
  - Conducted a thorough review of `node_modules` to eliminate unused or outdated modules.

### Upgrades and Modernization

- **React Native Upgrade**:
  - Migrated to a **bridgeless architecture** for better performance and maintainability.
- **State Management Enhancements**:
  - Integrated **Redux** for efficient state management.
- **React Query Migration**:
  - Migrated from version 3 to version 5 for improved data fetching and caching.
- **Animation Framework Updates**:
  - Upgraded to the latest version of **Reanimated**.

### Build Optimization

- **Faster Build Times**:
  - Transitioned builds to **Mac Mini**, reducing build times by 33% (from 45 minutes to 15 minutes).
- **Optimized Build Scripts**:
  - Streamlined scripts to further accelerate the build process.

Through these contributions, our team successfully stabilized and enhanced the mobile application, delivering a faster, more reliable, and user-friendly experience for global clients.
