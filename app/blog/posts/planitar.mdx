#### Camera UI design

I decided to create the designs and share with my team and designer and explain the navigation system, data and features for the camera system

#### Mobile Design

I recreated the application with a modern touch. I investigated the current design which gave me deeper comparison. Through making these designs I understand the current user story abd  where there is room for better user experiences. 

I really liked doing this first because its about interpreting my understand of standardaized design practices.Porjects are not without short commings but before looking at the code its exciting process to show enthusiasm, creativity, understanding, reasoning and practicallity. 

Next I walk through how to go from current designs, its a interesting practice because design language can be established at this point. 

You understand the application for what a user sees it as.
