## Development

### Backend

##### Highlights:

1. Built GraphQL resolvers for primary features:

- Check in/out
- Requesting to take/schedule user for a shift
- Viewing/editing information

2. Built fully featured Subscription resolvers with Push Notification service, working with mobile and web clients
3. User authentication and server side Authorization for web and mobile clients using access and refresh of JWT
4. Defined relational data models, gathered requirements, vetted normalization, security, and iteration, and planned migration tactics for production

Illustrated below is a section of how notifications for checking in/out and hours contribution are modeled.

```tsx
// Check-in and out times of a shift notification
  type NotificationStatus {
    id: ID! @id
    sender_user_notification: UserNotification!
    @relation(link: INLINE,
    name: "UserNotificiationToNotificationGroupMember",
    onDelete: SET_NULL)
    receiver_group_notification: GroupNotification!
    @relation(link: INLINE,
    name: "GroupNotificationToNotificationGroupMember",
    onDelete: SET_NULL)
    message: String
    is_checked: Boolean! @default(value: false)
    is_answered: Boolean! @default(value: false)
    is_accepted: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  }
```

```tsx
// Check-in and out times of a shift
  type Report {
    id: ID! @id
    reported_in_by: ID
    reported_out_by: ID
    check_in: DateTime
    check_out: DateTime
    updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
    createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  }
// Model is used to accurately track hours,
// Provides 1 level of validation.
```

An example of how our app provides organizations, individuals and the United Nations progress analysis, in relation to the 2030 accurately.
