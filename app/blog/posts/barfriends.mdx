### Business Strategy / Growth

To accomplish growth for app and ad based business model on a data-driven strategy, the application will have in-app surveys and app analytics. Python (Numpy and Pandas) will be used to perform analysis for strategic expansion and provide data to business partners. Having clear data gathers and analysis is key to sustaining growth and attracting users, advertisers and businesses.

##### Localized and Global Marketing and Branding

Tailored marketing and branding features will resonate with the local audiences. Our app nature of localized region-specific, allows advertisers from big to small to make cultural references in their advertising materials.

##### Build Local Partnerships

Barfriends will collaborate with local businesses, such as restaurants, bars, venues, organizations, or influencers, our goal is to expand our audience and gain relationships with venues and advertisers bringing value directly to their customer base. Goals in stage one foster and generate relationships, grow core data providing information, attract advertisers, begin influencer and venue partnerships.

##### Ad Integration

Localized advertising is an opportunity for large, medium and small businesses. Targeting audiences 18-25, we can find/attract unique advertisers that have capital but don't use mainstream socials. An example of an advertiser is a micro brewery, medium sized restaurant franchises, and event coordinator companies like XL-lifestyle.
Barfriends accommodates larger and smaller companies with localized advertisement, where they can test a promotion or be able to afford a promotion.
